# Wordle tui - a simple wordle game in C++ with a text user interface



## uniform syntax rules/conventions
```
- use the same syntax rules for all the code
- use the same naming conventions for all the code
- use the same indentation for all the code
- use the same comments for all the code
- use the same error handling for all the code
- use the same logging for all the code
- use the same testing for all the code
```
### naming conventions
```
- use the cpp modules naming conventions for classes and as much C conventions for functions
- use the same naming conventions for all the code
- variables: snake_case 
- functions: camelCase
- classes: CamelCase
- private variables: _snake_case
```
### indentation
```
- width of indentation: 4 spaces
- width of tab: 4 spaces
```
### comments
```
- inside the code: // comment
- outside the code: /* comment */
- each function or group of functions that work together should have a comment explaining:
    - what the function does
    - what the function returns
    - what the function parameters are
    - what the function calls (which functions it calls)
    - what the function is called by (which functions call it)
    - if its a group of functions explain how they work together
```
```example
/*
@description: adds two numbers
@returns: the sum of the two numbers
@params: two ints a, b
@calls: none
@called by: main
*/
```
